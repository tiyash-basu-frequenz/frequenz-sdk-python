## Introduction

A development kit to interact with the Frequenz development platform.

## Supported Platforms

This SDK is supported on and thoroughly tested with the following platforms:

- **Python:** 3.11
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 20.04
- **Architectures:** amd64, arm64

## Quick Start

We assume you are on a system with Python available. If that is not the case,
please [download and install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) first.

To install the SDK, you probably want to create a new virtual environment first.
For example, if you use a `sh` compatible shell, you can do this:

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
```

Then, just install using `pip`:

```sh
python3 -m pip install frequenz-sdk
```
